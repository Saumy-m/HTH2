SkillBuddy: Build New Skills, Make New Friends

Authors: Rayyan Sait, Saumya Mehta, Damon Gee

Requirements: MongoDB, node.js

SKillBuddy is a self-improvement app designed to connect people with the best motivator: other people.
It's a friendship app catered to post-secondary students looking to get better at their hobbies, habits, 
interests, and the like, but who may not have a ton of time or energy to focus on that alone. Matching 
people with others who are looking to improve in the same areas gives them a way to share experience and 
hold each other accountable in working towards their goals.

Current features include a profile system, a match-weighting algorithm, and up to 3 hobbies per person.

Planned features include groups that many users can join, unlimited hobbies with variable interest 
levels, and an improved matching system.
